#The NK2 file format.

= Introduction =

_Microsoft Outlook_ stores its autocomplete data in a specially-crafted, binary file (NK2). Its format is *not documented*, presumably because it is regarded as an internal data structure to the program. Still, the contents of that file are often valuable, and are definately worth keeping. 

The python library of this project, _nk2parser.py_ successfully pulls out *names* and *email addresses* from the file. Here's how.

= Details =

1. Luckily, the most important data is also most easy to pull out. The email addresses are stored as ascii strings, so by just running _strings_ on the file, you'll get all the addresses.
2. To get the names assosciated with the addresses, you have to dig deeper.

== NUL-byte separated strings ==

== Record separators ==

== SMTP addresses ==
