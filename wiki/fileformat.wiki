#The NK2 file format.

= Introduction =

_Microsoft Outlook_ stores its autocomplete data in a specially-crafted, binary file (NK2). Its format is *not documented*, presumably because it is regarded as an internal data structure to the program. Still, the contents of that file are often valuable, and are definately worth keeping. 

I have successfully pulled out *names* and *email addresses* from the file. This is what I've learned about the file format.

= Details =

1. Luckily, the most important data is also most easy to pull out. The email addresses are stored as ascii strings, so by just running _strings_ on the file, you'll get all the addresses.
2. To get the names assosciated with the addresses, you have to dig deeper.
