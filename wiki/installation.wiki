The program is written in [http://python.org/ python] script, and turned into a pretty [http://www.trolltech.com/qt Qt gui] by [http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt PyQt4].

== Windows ==

=== Manual install ===

  # Get the current windows zip archive from the project pages
  # Unpack the archive and run `debunk2.exe`

=== Slick install ===

As of 2007-01-24, there is no installer, but work to assemble one (and to cut down on the size of the resulting archive) is under way.

== Linux ==

=== Debian / Ubuntu ===

  # Get the current .deb from the project pages
  # Install using `sudo dpkg -i <debunk-0.x.deb>`


== Source ==

On all platforms, the program can be installed by downloading the zip file, getting all requirements and running the `debunk2.py` file within the zip file.
