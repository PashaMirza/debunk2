#summary How to install the program

= Introduction =

The program is written in [http://python.org/ python] script, and turned into a pretty [http://www.trolltech.com/qt Qt gui] by [http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt PyQt4]. 

All of these are requirements for running this program.

== Source ==

On all platforms, the program can be installed by downloading the zip file, getting all requirements and running the `debunk2.py` file within the zip file.

There are installers for some platforms: 

== Linux ==

=== Debian / Ubuntu ===

  # Get the current .deb from the project pages
  # Install using `sudo dpkg -i <debunk-0.x.deb>`


== Windows ==

=== Manual install ===

  # Get [http://python.org/ The Python interpreter], and install it
  # Get [http://www.trolltech.com/qt Qt, Open Source edition] and install it
  # Get [http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/download.php The PyQt4 package], and install it
  # Get the current .zip from the project front page
  # Run start.bat

=== Slick install ===

Creating this little program as an installer for Windows is a bit tricky. The Qt and Python dependencies are very heavy, and distributing them all together would mean an archive of 19 MB, way too heavy for a tiny program like this.

There is currently no installer for Windows for this reason. Sorry. Any ideas on how to solve this are appreciated.
